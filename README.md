## **Overview**

Hey everyone! I am on day 18 of Kevin Powell's Respnsove Website course. I completed his flexbox challenge 4 and was hoping that someone could review it for me.
When I did the challenge on my own, I did it desktop-first and you can find that solution as [index1.html](index.html) and its corresponding stylesheet [style1.css](style1.css), but when I saw Kevin Powell's solution, he had made the website mobile-first so I decided to do the same and you can find that solution as [index2.html](index2.html) and its corresponding stylesheet [style2.css](style2.css).

 ### The Challenge
